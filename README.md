# 🏟️ All Sports Analytics Repository  
A unified analytics hub covering NFL, Soccer, NBA, and more — from data engineering to predictive modeling, and advanced simulations.

This repository organizes all sports analytics projects under a single structure, making it easy to maintain, scale, and present as a portfolio.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repo serves two goals:

### **1) Centralized Management**
Instead of creating many independent repos (NFL, Soccer, NBA…),  
all sports analytics projects live under one roof.

### **2) Career-Ready Portfolio**
Each sport folder is structured as an industry-standard analytics pipeline:
- **Data engineering**  
- **Exploratory analysis**
- **Feature generation**
- **Machine learning models**
- **Simulation / forecasting**
- **Visualizations**

## 🏈 Current Completed Project: NFL EPA-Based Analytics

The NFL pipeline includes:
1. **League Data Prep / EDA**
2. **Team Style Clustering (Master Styles)**
3. **Rolling EPA-based Dynamic Feature Engineering**
4. **Pre-game Win Probability Modeling**
5. **2024–2025 Season Simulation (Monte Carlo + Expected Wins)**

## ⚽ Upcoming Projects (Planned)
These projects will be added under their respective sport folders.

### **Soccer**
- Team style clusters (Europe big 5)
- Match-level expected goals + rolling form features
- Predictive modeling (win/draw/loss)
- Season simulations / league table forecasting

### **NBA**
- Four Factors analytics
- Possession-based prediction models
- Player clustering (archetypes)
- Game outcome simulations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- SHAP Interpretability
- SciPy / StatsModels
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 How to Navigate  
Each sport folder contains:
- **its own README.md**
- **notebooks/** with ordered pipeline
- **data/** with `raw` & `processed` directories

This structure ensures:
✔ Clean separation per sport  
✔ Reproducibility  
✔ Easy portfolio review for employers
